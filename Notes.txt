Create file (touch)
After changes to file, stage it (git add)

Staging server
	- Different developers put together their features branch into the develop branch
Production server

After creating and finishing your feature branch, push that into github or other remote server.
	- So that other's can review it
	- You want the feature branch to be reviewed before it's merged into the develop branch

Reviewer: Pull feature branch in github or other repository so that you can review and comment on it. 

Once review is complete, and quality passed, then merge it into develop branch
